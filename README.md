CSharpDelegatesToLambdas
========================

A short example showing how to go from C# delegates to lambdas.

Lambdas are well understood by most developers these days. But I created this sample to show to some co-workers a few years ago when lambdas were first introduced. They were using the syntax but did not fully understand it and how it worked. I wanted to provide an example to show the transition from delegates in .NET 2.0 to lambdas. I also provided some blog posts to further expand on the sample but those are gone unfortunately. Perhaps this code will help others grok lambdas.
